1. The error of the critical activity function was corrected 

Revision Date: May 26, 2022
1. Creates a function BFS_adjmatrix_path that uses BFS method to create a path from the beginning to the end of a graph.
2. Creates a function Maximum_flow that takes capacity as input and finds the maximum value that can flow to the Sink.

Revision Date: May 21, 2022
1. The print_adjmatrix function was changed in a way suitable for outputting a three-digit weight.
2. Create a function critical_activity that takes network as input and finds the maximum time and deadline for the task and then finds the critical task.

Revision Date: May 17, 2022
1. A variable to contain outdegree information was added to the network structure.
2. The set_topology function now updates the outdegrees information as well.
3. Creates a DFS_revtopsort function that searches the graph in the outdegree direction.
4. Creates a function strong_recur that detects the part of the graph that creates the cycle.

Revision Date: May 14, 2022
1. Create a function floyd that updates reachability considering weight.
2. The dijkstra function was modified not to change the contents of the graph.
3. A structure network was created to store the topology of the graph.
4. Creates a function set_indegree that updates the preceding conditions in the net structure.
5. Create a function set_topology that updates the net structure by receiving information from the graph.
6. Create a function DFS_toport that explores graphs containing prerequisites in a DFS manner.

Revision Date: May 5, 2022
1. Created an Input function for directed graph.
2. DFS and BFS search functions were upgraded to update parent.
3. DFS and BFS search functions for directed graphs were added.
4. Created a warshall function for add an direct edge between reachable nodes.
5. The print score function was modified to properly detect ROOT.
Discussion: Can warshall function really consider all reachable nodes?

Revision Date: May 2, 2022
1. Added the shortest_adjlist function to find the minimum path of the graph expressed as a list.
2. Added the dijkstra function to find the minimum path of the graph expressed as a matrix.
3. Renamed node header to queue header.
4. Now in the check array, 0 means the root node.
5. A kruskal function that performs PFS SEARCH around the edge was added.
6. Find_set and union_set functions were added to assist the kruskal function
7. The pq_update function was renamed to the heap_update function and moved to the heap header.

Revision Date: April 19, 2022 
1. Modified the data type of Parent.
2. Modified the data type of GL.
3. Modified the parameter data type of input_adjlist and print_adjlist.
4. A function to output a score based on the search path was added.
Discussion: Articulation points are likely to be related to finding the shortest path.

Revision Date: April 13, 2022 
1. input_adjlist now accepts input as a file.
2. Node structures now have weights as variables.
3. print_adjlist now outputs weights as well.
4. The heap now sets the maximum value based on the weight.
5. A heap sort function adjust_heap was added.
6. A function pq_update was added to update weights and heaps.
7. A function pis_adjlist that searches for NODE through the PFS algorithm was added.
8. The print_heap function outputs weights and outputs characters instead of integers.
9. Added a variable 'parent' that stores the node that called itself.
10. Added a function print_tree that outputs the tree structure.

Revision Date: April 11, 2022 
1. Recursion project integrated.
2. Separate into header and source for code brevity of graph search project.
3. Add codes related to heap (note that they are implemented differently from the class)
